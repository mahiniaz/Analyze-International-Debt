- The total number of distinct countries in the dataset.
- The country with the highest total debt.
- The country with the lowest principal repayment (debt repayments).

The project is implemented using SQL for data extraction and analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualizations.

**SQL and Power BI skills:**

After completing the analysis, the project provides valuable insights into international debt statistics:

✅ Distinct Countries in the Dataset: (e.g., 120 countries)
✅ Country with the Highest Total Debt: (e.g., USA - $5 Billion)
✅ Country with the Lowest Principal Repayment: (e.g., Bangladesh - $12 Million)
✅ Interactive Power BI Dashboard with:

- Top 10 countries by total debt
- Country with the highest debt (Bar Chart)
- Country with lowest repayments (Table/Bar Chart)
- Slicers to filter by country and debt type
